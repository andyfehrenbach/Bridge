# Bridge Guitar Capo Utility
The app that makes playing guitar with a capo easy.

## What is Bridge? 
Bridge is my first solo app build. The app gets chord data from a database, then sorts the chords into musical keys and draws chord diagram SVGs onto the dom. From there, the chords can be transposed into a different key, or called into recommendations for playing in different keys.

## Tech Used
Bridge is built using the MEAN Stack and SASS with Bourbon mixins, as well as the [Chordography Script](http://chordography.blogspot.com/) script by Clive Grant.
